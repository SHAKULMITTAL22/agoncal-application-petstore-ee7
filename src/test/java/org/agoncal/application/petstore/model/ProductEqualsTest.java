Scenario 1: Same Object Comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject
  Description: Tests the equals method by passing the same Product object to verify if it identifies them as equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and assign it to two different references.
  Act: Call the equals method by passing one reference to the other.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should return true when the same object is compared with itself, confirming the reflexive property of the equals contract.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the method correctly identifies the same instance as equal, which is fundamental for reliable equality checks in collections and other data structures.
Scenario 2: Different Class Comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClass
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Product instance, passing the different class instance.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The equals method should return false when comparing objects of different types, as per Java's equals contract.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures robust type checking within the equals method, which is crucial for preventing ClassCastException and maintaining logical equality checks.
Scenario 3: Comparison with Null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: Test the equals method by passing a null reference to verify that it handles null correctly by returning false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Product instance, passing null.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should return false when null is passed, adhering to the standard equals contract.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the method safely handles null inputs, which is essential for avoiding NullPointerException in runtime.
Scenario 4: Objects with Different State
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentState
  Description: Checks the equals method by comparing two Product objects with different name and description fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product instances with different values for name and description.
  Act: Call the equals method, comparing one product with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should return false when the key fields (name and description) differ, ensuring that the equality check is based on content equality.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures accurate content-based comparison, which is crucial for logical data integrity and correct behavior in collections relying on equals, such as HashMap and HashSet.
Scenario 5: Objects with Same State
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalFields
  Description: Validates the equals method by comparing two Product objects with identical name and description fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product instances with the same values for name and description.
  Act: Call the equals method, comparing one product with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should return true when both objects have identical key fields, confirming that the equality check is correctly implemented based on object content.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for ensuring that objects representing the same data are recognized as equal, important for consistency and correctness in data processing and storage mechanisms.
