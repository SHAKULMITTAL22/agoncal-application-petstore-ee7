ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_44411a81c8
Scenario 1: Both name and description are null
Details:
  TestName: hashWithNullNameAndDescription
  Description: Tests the hashCode method when both 'name' and 'description' fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with 'name' and 'description' set to null.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code for null values.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test verifies the consistency of the hashCode method when dealing with null inputs. This is important as handling null gracefully is crucial to avoid NullPointerException in hash-based collections.
Scenario 2: Different objects with same name and description
Details:
  TestName: hashWithSameNameAndDescription
  Description: Tests the hashCode method with two different instances having the same 'name' and 'description'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the class with the same 'name' and 'description'.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that both instances return the same hash code.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test ensures that the hashCode method adheres to the contract of returning the same hash code for objects that are equal in terms of their 'name' and 'description'. This ensures consistent behavior in hash-based collections.
Scenario 3: Objects with different names and same description
Details:
  TestName: hashWithDifferentNamesSameDescription
  Description: Tests the hashCode method on instances where 'name' differs but 'description' is the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with different 'name' values but the same 'description'.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned are different.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test checks how the hashCode method differentiates objects based on their 'name' even if 'description' is the same. This test confirms that the hash code computation correctly incorporates multiple field values, ensuring accurate placement in hash-based collections.
Scenario 4: Objects with same name and different descriptions
Details:
  TestName: hashWithSameNameDifferentDescriptions
  Description: Tests the hashCode method on instances where 'name' is the same but 'description' differs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with the same 'name' but different 'description' values.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned are different.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test examines how the hashCode method manages to generate different hash codes for objects that share the same 'name' but have different 'description'. This ensures that the hash code is sensitive to all relevant fields, providing effective distribution in hash-based collections.
Scenario 5: Non-null name and description with special characters
Details:
  TestName: hashWithSpecialCharactersInFields
  Description: Tests the hashCode method with 'name' and 'description' containing special characters and spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with 'name' and 'description' containing spaces and special characters (e.g., "Name! @Name", "Desc #Description").
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that a valid hash code is returned and no exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify that this test ensures the robustness of the hashCode method when handling strings with special characters and spaces, confirming that the method can handle a wide range of string inputs effectively.
