Here are your existing test cases which we found out and not considered for test generation:
Scenario 1: Set Positive Version Number
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveVersionNumber
  Description: This test checks if the `setVersion` method correctly assigns a positive integer to the `version` field of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the `setVersion` method with a positive integer, e.g., `setVersion(1)`.
  Assert: Assert that the `version` field of the class instance is now equal to 1.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test validates that the method correctly updates the `version` field with a positive value, which is a common real-world scenario.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that version numbers can be set correctly is crucial for version control and tracking changes in entities.
Scenario 2: Set Negative Version Number
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeVersionNumber
  Description: This test verifies that the `setVersion` method can handle negative integers, checking if negative values are appropriately assigned to the `version` field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the `setVersion` method with a negative integer, e.g., `setVersion(-1)`.
  Assert: Assert that the `version` field of the class instance is now equal to -1.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test checks the method's ability to handle and assign negative numbers, which might be important if negative versions have a specific meaning in the application.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Negative version numbers might represent special conditions or states in some systems, so ensuring correct handling is essential.
Scenario 3: Set Version Number to Zero
Details:
  TestName: setVersionNumberToZero
  Description: This test ensures that the `setVersion` method correctly handles the edge case of setting the version number to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the `setVersion` method with zero, e.g., `setVersion(0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the `version` field of the class instance is now equal to 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test confirms that zero, as an edge case, is handled correctly by the method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Zero might represent an uninitialized or reset state for the version, so its correct handling is crucial.
Scenario 4: Validate Version Field Default Null State
Details:
  TestName: validateVersionFieldDefaultNullState
  Description: This test checks the initial state of the `version` field to confirm that it starts as null, aligning with class initialization behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the version.
  Act: No action needed as we are testing the initial state.
  Assert: Assert that the `version` field of the class instance is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test ensures that the initial null state of the `version` field is maintained until explicitly set, which can be critical for understanding object state before any operations.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that fields are correctly initialized to null can help prevent unintended behavior or errors in applications relying on specific initial states.
