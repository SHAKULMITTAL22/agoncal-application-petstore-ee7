Here are your existing test cases which we found out and not considered for test generation:
Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of version number
Details:
  TestName: getVersionBasic
  Description: Test to verify that the getVersion method correctly retrieves the version number of the product instance when it is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product instance and set the version number to a known value, e.g., 1.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the set version number.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Checks if the getVersion method accurately fetches the version field's value.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic, ensuring that the product version management works as intended.
Scenario 2: Version default state retrieval
Details:
  TestName: getVersionDefault
  Description: Test to ensure that the getVersion method returns the default value of the version field when it is not explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new product instance without setting the version.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the newly created product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is the default value for integers, which should be 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Ensures that uninitialized version fields default to zero, reflecting typical Java behavior for int fields.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in verifying that the product's version handling correctly deals with uninitialized states.
Scenario 3: Version retrieval after modification
Details:
  TestName: getVersionAfterModification
  Description: Test to verify that getVersion reflects updates to the version number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product instance and set the version. Modify the version to a new value, e.g., from 1 to 2.
  Act: Call the getVersion method after the update.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the new version number.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Validates that the getVersion method provides the current state of the version field after it has been modified.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in ensuring that updates to the product's version are accurately reflected and managed within the application.
Scenario 4: Concurrent access to getVersion
Details:
  TestName: getVersionWithConcurrency
  Description: Test to check if concurrent calls to getVersion return consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a product instance and set the version. Simulate concurrent access by invoking getVersion from multiple threads.
  Act: Call the getVersion method concurrently from different threads.
  Assert: Assert that all returned values from the different threads are identical.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Ensures that getVersion method is thread-safe and returns consistent results when accessed concurrently.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in a multi-threaded environment, ensuring consistent behavior under concurrent usage.
